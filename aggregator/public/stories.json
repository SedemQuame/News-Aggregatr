The Stadium, Training Ground, the quality of the playing staff and the young players coming through and of course the fan base that has remained loyal and supportive,’ Rooney told the club’s official website.‘‘Despite other offers I knew instinctively Derby County was the place for me.‘To be given the opportunity to follow the likes of Brian Clough, Jim Smith, Frank Lampard and Phillip Cocu is such an honour and I can promise everyone in involved in the club and all our fans, my staff and I will leave no stone unturned in achieving the potential I have witnessed over the last 12 months of this historic football club.’ <img loading=\"lazy\" id=\"i-5986538a701f67f\" src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/15/14/38048026-9151547-image-a-129_1610719828672.jpg\" height=\"778\" width=\"634\" alt=\"Bursting into the England set-up as a teenager, Rooney became the national team&#039;s all-time leading scorer but couldn&#039;t help them win a tournament\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" title=\"Wayne Rooney named new Derby County boss on a two-and-a-half year deal 14\">Bursting into the England set-up as a teenager, Rooney became the national team’s all-time leading scorer but couldn’t help them win a tournament <img loading=\"lazy\" id=\"i-49e37ee2fea86086\" src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/15/14/38048034-9151547-image-a-131_1610719862081.jpg\" height=\"447\" width=\"634\" alt=\"Rooney was renowned for spectacular goals, not least this bicycle kick for Manchester United against local rivals Manchester City in 2011\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" title=\"Wayne Rooney named new Derby County boss on a two-and-a-half year deal 16\">Rooney was renowned for spectacular goals, not least this bicycle kick for Manchester United against local rivals Manchester City in 2011 <img loading=\"lazy\" id=\"i-d21fbfa4b1045206\" src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/15/14/38049052-9151547-image-a-132_1610720329517.jpg\" height=\"491\" width=\"634\" alt=\"Rooney lifts the European Cup after Manchester United&#039;s win over Chelsea in 2008\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" title=\"Wayne Rooney named new Derby County boss on a two-and-a-half year deal 18\">Rooney lifts the European Cup after Manchester United’s win over Chelsea in 2008 <img loading=\"lazy\" id=\"i-4bf714398f129d0d\" src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/15/14/38048044-9151547-image-a-130_1610719859850.jpg\" height=\"426\" width=\"634\" alt=\"He joined Derby as a player last January and then became caretaker manager in November\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" title=\"Wayne Rooney named new Derby County boss on a two-and-a-half year deal 20\">He joined Derby as a player last January and then became caretaker manager in NovemberRooney will take charge of his first game as permanent manager on Saturday at home to Championship rivals Rotherham United.But he will have his work cut out with Derby currently in the relegation zone in England’s second tier.And speaking about the Rams’ new era under Rooney, their chief executive officer Stephen Pearce couldn’t contain his excitement.‘Our recent upturn in results under Wayne was married together with some positive performances, notably the 2-0 home win over Swansea City and the 4-0 victory at Birmingham City.‘During that nine-game run we also dramatically improved their defensive record and registered five clean sheets in the process, while in the attacking third we became more effective and ruthless too.‘Those foundations have provided a platform for the club to build on in the second half of the season under Wayne’s guidance.’Source link ",

    "paragraphs": "After ‘caving in’ hibernation for a long while and taking a total break from politics, a picture of Chief Executive Officer of Groupe Ndoum Companies, Dr. Papa Kwesi Ndoum looking all old with a grey-bearded face has surfaced on social media.The astute businessman who always appeared in public with his beard nicely shaved with little facial hair is now captured with ‘unkempt’ hair all over his face.Although unclear what necessitated such a look, social media users are suggesting it could be as a result of the numerous challenges he had been through these past few years.Below are some of the few issues:Financial ChallengesWith over 30 years of existence, The Bank of Ghana earlier in 2019 closed down the Groupe Ndoum (GN bank) and other micro finances for their inability to meet the minimum capital of GHC400 million.\nThe decision affected more than 3,000 employees at GN Bank who lost their jobs due to shut-down.Gold Coast Fund Management, another member of Groupe Nduom, also struggled just like defunct GN Bank, which was downgraded to a Savings and Loans before its license was finally withdrawn by the Bank of Ghana.Customers of the defunct Gold Coast Securities Limited have since demonstrated for their locked up funds amidst several street protests, lawsuits, and so on.Health crisesIn August 2020, the Groupe Nduom President was reported to have said the revocation of the license of his financial institution has caused the health of many people, including himself to deteriorate.Describing how he felt when the incident happened, Dr. Ndoum described that particular day as “a day of infamy, treachery, and robbery of the rights and assets of indigenous Ghanaian entrepreneurship”.Take a look at the picture below<img src=\"https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/pics/932/93275976.jpg\" alt=\"93275976\" title=\"Dr Paa Kwesi Nduom unrecognized in latest photo 1\">",

My problem with Afia is that she should stop destroying the brands of celebrities to people living abroad who want to work with them. She should stop tarnishing their brands. We need to unite. You had something to say about Shatta Wale, young actress Maame Serwaa, whom Pinamang wanted to help by signing her after her mom’s death too, you destroyed her to the woman. She sent the woman audio telling her Maame Serwaa’s brand is not a good brand. Like who does that? Who does that? So you want to be the center of the woman’s life and benefit alone?” she told Ola Michael on the show.The two media personalities have for some tie now constantly been at each other’s throats with issues relating to Pinamang Cosmetics among other damaging issues.",

    "paragraphs": "After ‘caving in’ hibernation for a long while and taking a total break from politics, a picture of Chief Executive Officer of Groupe Ndoum Companies, Dr. Papa Kwesi Ndoum looking all old with a grey-bearded face has surfaced on social media.The astute businessman who always appeared in public with his beard nicely shaved with little facial hair is now captured with ‘unkempt’ hair all over his face.Although unclear what necessitated such a look, social media users are suggesting it could be as a result of the numerous challenges he had been through these past few years.Below are some of the few issues:Financial ChallengesWith over 30 years of existence, The Bank of Ghana earlier in 2019 closed down the Groupe Ndoum (GN bank) and other micro finances for their inability to meet the minimum capital of GHC400 million.\n The decision affected more than 3,000 employees at GN Bank who lost their jobs due to shut-down.Gold Coast Fund Management, another member of Groupe Nduom, also struggled just like defunct GN Bank, which was downgraded to a Savings and Loans before its license was finally withdrawn by the Bank of Ghana.Customers of the defunct Gold Coast Securities Limited have since demonstrated for their locked up funds amidst several street protests, lawsuits, and so on.Health crisesIn August 2020, the Groupe Nduom President was reported to have said the revocation of the license of his financial institution has caused the health of many people, including himself to deteriorate.Describing how he felt when the incident happened, Dr. Ndoum described that particular day as “a day of infamy, treachery, and robbery of the rights and assets of indigenous Ghanaian entrepreneurship”.Take a look at the picture below<img src=\"https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/pics/932/93275976.jpg\" alt=\"93275976\" title=\"Dr Paa Kwesi Nduom unrecognized in latest photo 1\">",

Mum it did not stop there.I rushed to a friend’s house who always asked me, if me and my younger sister came from same mom often to relate the issue to her and she told me that she knew but was scared letting me know.

Anthony (Martial) is one of the best players one against one in the box.

    "header": "Man United are top of the Premier League but Liverpool clash is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s acid test",
    "paragraphs": "Having waited so long for Manchester United to return to the top of the Premier League, few expected it to happen this season.Now they are there, what does it mean? If they don’t manage to stay there, maybe not very much.Perhaps with this in mind, United’s own manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer cut to the heart of the matter very well, in advance of Sunday’s visit to Liverpool. <img loading=\"lazy\" id=\"i-5ea3cf9284026239\" src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/15/19/38061078-0-image-a-119_1610739423949.jpg\" height=\"409\" width=\"634\" alt=\"38061078 0 image a 119 1610739423949\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" title=\"Man United are top of the Premier League but Liverpool clash is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&#039;s acid test 2\">Manchester United may be top but they face their real acid test at Liverpool on Sunday <img loading=\"lazy\" id=\"i-fa3d52d279cfe734\" src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/15/19/38060830-9152771-image-a-102_1610739080502.jpg\" height=\"409\" width=\"634\" alt=\"United are breathing fresh life into the title race, rivalling Manchester City and the champions\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" title=\"Man United are top of the Premier League but Liverpool clash is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&#039;s acid test 4\">United are breathing fresh life into the title race, rivalling Manchester City and the champions‘This a test and reality check of where we’re at,’ said Solskjaer. ‘We’ve recently won many tight games, scored a few goals in injury time, showed that good mentality. But we’ve not really set the world alight too many times and to win at Anfield you really need to be at your best level.’There has been a degree of giddiness around since Tuesday night’s win over Burnley took United top. For the Premier League, it makes a change from seeing Liverpool or Manchester City in first position. For United supporters embarrassed by recent regression, it hints at brighter days.But Solskjaer’s analysis was appropriate. United have improved and for that he takes credit. But by how much? <img loading=\"lazy\" id=\"i-18810709072c8ca8\" src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/15/19/38060878-9152771-image-a-103_1610739083128.jpg\" height=\"442\" width=\"634\" alt=\"There has been a giddiness at the club since the Red Devils went top at Burnley on Tuesday\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" title=\"Man United are top of the Premier League but Liverpool clash is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&#039;s acid test 6\">There has been a giddiness at the club since the Red Devils went top at Burnley on Tuesday <img loading=\"lazy\" id=\"i-e4561e4f605d340c\" src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/15/21/38064296-9152771-image-a-172_1610745884136.jpg\" height=\"1425\" width=\"306\" alt=\"38064296 9152771 image a 172 1610745884136\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" title=\"Man United are top of the Premier League but Liverpool clash is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&#039;s acid test 8\">Their last three league victories — against Burnley, Aston Villa and Wolves — have been by a single goal. Against City in the Carabao Cup less than a fortnight ago, they were well beaten.So perhaps Sunday will tell us if Solskjaer has genuinely moved United back into elite company or whether modest performances against other big clubs — league draws with Chelsea and City at home and defeats by Tottenham and Arsenal — actually remain a more accurate indicator of status. Undoubtedly, this is a good time to play Liverpool. United’s away form is exceptional while Jurgen Klopp’s champions are down on numbers, form and confidence.There has been no joy about Liverpool’s recent football while United run hot on confidence. Make no mistake, this is an opportunity for United to make as big a mark on any single competition since Sir Alex Ferguson stood down in 2013.‘Everyone wants to be the champion and everyone wants to beat them,’ said Solskjaer, veteran of six title wins as a player at Old Trafford. ‘Liverpool have earned the right to be looked up to. Our position at the moment is a product of all the hard work we’ve done every single day.‘We probably deserve to be where we’re at. But six weeks ago I don’t think many would have thought of another word for it than an ‘upset’ if we beat Liverpool at Anfield. It would be a shock’.United’s improvement is such that they have eleven more points than this time last season. Liverpool, on the other hand, have sixteen points fewer.Key to the improved fortunes of Solskjaer’s team has been the enduring quality brought to them by playmaker Bruno Fernandes and the fact they have suffered so few injuries. It will be interesting to see if there will be any change to either between now and the season’s end.Klopp acknowledged on Friday that Liverpool had been aware of Fernandes when he was at Sporting Lisbon. ‘You could really see he was a difference-maker, and that’s what he shows now,’ said Klopp.‘He’s settled, very influential for United. People talk mostly about goal involvements, which is very important, but it’s also his link-up. He’s involved in a lot of other situations.‘He seems to be a leader as well, so yes, good singing. Unfortunately!’ <img loading=\"lazy\" id=\"i-5c4356095dda45b3\" src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/15/19/38060836-9152771-image-a-104_1610739088065.jpg\" height=\"423\" width=\"634\" alt=\"However, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&#039;s side&#039;s recent wins have been with a margin of just one goal\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" title=\"Man United are top of the Premier League but Liverpool clash is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&#039;s acid test 10\">However, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side’s recent wins have been with a margin of just one goal <img loading=\"lazy\" id=\"i-86ed7dc7287bf12d\" src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/15/19/38060918-9152771-image-a-105_1610739123973.jpg\" height=\"423\" width=\"634\" alt=\"United&#039;s upturn in form can be attributed to the influence of talisman Bruno Fernandes\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" title=\"Man United are top of the Premier League but Liverpool clash is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&#039;s acid test 12\">United’s upturn in form can be attributed to the influence of talisman Bruno Fernandes <img loading=\"lazy\" id=\"i-22b114aabdd895bb\" src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/15/19/38060966-9152771-image-a-106_1610739173055.jpg\" height=\"421\" width=\"634\" alt=\"United have fallen flat against their big six rivals and need a strong performance at Anfield\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" title=\"Man United are top of the Premier League but Liverpool clash is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&#039;s acid test 14\">United have fallen flat against their big six rivals and need a strong performance at AnfieldLiverpool are unlikely to make any special arrangements for Fernandes on Sunday. Of greater concern will be what they do with the ball when they have it.United are not proficient enough to dominate possession against the really good sides so their best hope will be to play the kind of counter-attacking football capable of laying waste to teams.Liverpool simply have to be better than they recently have been. They will need more from players such as Mo Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Thiago Alcantara. They will also need to defend better. Liverpool continue to feel the absence of Virgil van Dijk more and more and there is a danger here that players like Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood may blow right through them. <img loading=\"lazy\" id=\"i-9080888cae0b6a66\" src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/15/19/38060828-9152771-image-a-28_1610740397796.jpg\" height=\"391\" width=\"634\" alt=\"The United boss knows that his side needs to be at their very best to defeat Jurgen Klopp&#039;s side\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" title=\"Man United are top of the Premier League but Liverpool clash is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&#039;s acid test 16\">The United boss knows that his side needs to be at their very best to defeat Jurgen Klopp’s side <img loading=\"lazy\" id=\"i-32801f9411ed3cae\" src=\"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/01/15/21/38064298-9152771-image-a-173_1610745884137.jpg\" height=\"194\" width=\"306\" alt=\"38064298 9152771 image a 173 1610745884137\" class=\"blkBorder img-share\" title=\"Man United are top of the Premier League but Liverpool clash is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&#039;s acid test 18\">‘We have to be dominant in the game,’ was how Klopp put it on Friday and he was absolutely right.A win for United would see them six points clear of Liverpool, but not of the rest. City, for example, will be only a point behind if they win their game in hand. There are more than two teams in this league.Nevertheless, victory would represent the most significant single achievement of Solskjaer’s two years in charge so far.‘We are the challengers, we are the hunters,’ said Solskjaer. ‘Winning at Anfield remains one of the great challenges.’Source link ",
