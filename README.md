News aggregator, is a news aggregation software.

Where data is scraped from selected blogs online, stored into a database and then displayed on a very simple UI.

The tool, will internally represent data in a logical and categorical way. Money to be made through this would be via advertisements.

Below are some of the various sites that, the script will be aggregating from.
(The list has intentionally being kept to a minimum.) This is so as to test the concept, first.

a. Yen.com.gh
b. Pulse.com.gh
c. Browngh.com
d. Mfidie.com
e. Glusea.com

Other sites to scrape from can be found on

The script will have to scrape repeatedly and push data to the centralised database, which will be displayed on the UI.
